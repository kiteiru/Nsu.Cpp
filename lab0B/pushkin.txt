A wish 


     My days still linger, slow and rough
     Each moment multiplies the sadness
     Within the heart of hapless love
     Disturbing all the hopes of madness
     I'm silent; not a word I breathe.
     I weep, my tears -- my consolation
     My soul, held captive by the grief
     Still finds delight in this sensation.
     No longer do I care if life goes by,
     O, hollow phantom into darkness flee;
     The sorrow of my love is dear to me--
     If I die loving, then I pray let die!

     
 To *** 


     I still remember that amazing moment
     You have appeared before my sight
     As though a brief and fleeting omen,
     Pure phantom in enchanting light.

     Locked in depression's hopeless captive,
     In haste of clamorous processions,
     I heard your voice-- soft and attractive.
     And dreamt of your beloved expressions.

     Time passed. In gusts, rebellious and active,
     A tempest scattered my affections
     And I forgot your voice attractive,
     Your sacred and divine expressions.

     Detained in darkness, isolation,
     My days would slowly drag in strife.
     With lack of faith and inspiration,
     With lack of tears, and love and life.

     My soul attained its waking moment:
     You re-appeared before my sight,
     As though a brief and fleeting omen,
     Pure phantom in enchanting light.

     And now, my heart, in fascination
     Beats rapidly and finds revived:
     Devout faith and inspiration,
     And tender tears and love and life.

I loved you...


     I loved you and this love by chance,
     Inside my soul has never fully vanished;
     No longer shall it ever make you tense;
     I wouldn't want to sadden you with anguish.
     I loved you speechlessly and wildly,
     By modesty and jealousy was stressed;
     I loved you so sincerely and so mildly,
     As, God permit, may love you someone else.

     
 To *** 


     Don't ask me why alone in dismal thought
     In times of mirth, I'm often filled with strife,
     And why my weary stare is so distraught,
     And why I don't enjoy the dream of life;

     Don't ask me why my soul has slowly perished
     And ceased to love the love that pleased me then
     No longer can I call someone "my cherished"--
     Who once has loved will never love again;

     Who once felt bliss will never feel its essence,
     A moment's happiness is all that we receive:
     From youth, prosperity and joyful pleasance
     All that is left is apathy and grief...

     
 The Tenth Commandment 


     Don't covet goods of other beings --
     My Goodness, You've commanded so;
     The limits of my will You know --
     Am I to manage tender feelings?!
     I wish not to offend my friend,
     His village I do not desire,
     And for his steer I don't aspire,
     I'm gazing at it with content:
     His men, his house and his cattle,
     I'm tempted not, though all is great.
     But let's imagine that his maid
     Is beautiful... I've lost the battle!
     And if by chance his lady's pretty
     And gifted with an angel's skin
     Then God forgive me for my sin
     Of being envious and greedy!
     Who can command a heart like this?
     Who is a slave to feeble effort?
     Not love a person who is revered?--
     Who can resist the heaven's bliss?
     I sigh from sadness and perceive,
     But I must honor my conviction,
     Afraid to flatter heart's ambition,
     I'm silent... and alone I grieve.

     Oh what a night! The frost is creaking,
     Across the sky no clouds are creeping;
     The bluish dome, -- a knitted shade,
     Is dazzled with the frequent stars.
     All homes are dark. And every gate
     Is safely locked with bolts and bars.
     In people peacefulness' conveyed.
     The noisy market now is calm,
     The guarding dog just barks alone,
     And with the loud chains it rumbles.

     While all of Moscow's dead in slumber,
     The restlessness of fear forgetting.
     The square, in murkiness of night,
     Stands filled with yesterday's beheading.
     The torture's imprints still abide:
     Where yesterday a man was struck,
     Where there are pitchforks, where there are
     The cooled off cauldrons filled with tar;
     Where there's a tumbled over block;
     The metal teeth are sticking out,
     And bones with ashes are consumed,
     Upon the stakes, above the ground,
     Dead bodies darken from the fume...
     Not long ago, the blood was sliding
     Pigmenting snow along the way
     And languid moans were rising, rising,
     But death embraced them, tranquilizing,
     And overtook her easy prey.
     Who's there? Whose horse is it that's speeding
     Across the risky square in flight?
     Whose blaring whistle, loud speaking
     Is heard in twilight of the night?
     Who's he? -A slayer full of greed.
     He gallops, hurries to his date,
     By his desire made irate
     He pleads: "My valiant, intrepid steed,
     Fly like an arrow at full speed!
     Oh faster, faster!..." The ardent horse
     Just swung its mane, abruptly paused
     And stopped. Between the posts
     Upon the long and wooden crossbeam,
     A corpse was swaying. And the horseman
     Was ready to advance and cross,
     But for some reason under lashes
     The steed just sniffs and snorts and rushes
     Back. "Where to?! Ahead, ahead!
     What is with you! What is to dread?
     Just yesterday, right here we'd ride,
     Wasn't it us who stomped with pride,
     Inflamed with vengeance from afar,
     The evil traitors of the czar?
     It was their blood that we would use
     To wash and clean your steely hoofs!
     Have you forgotten all in spite?
     My daring steed, this is your course
     Now gallop, fly..." The tired horse
     Under the corpse would slowly ride.

***


     My friend, forgotten are the fleeting era's prints
     Forgotten is my youth's uprising flow
     Don't question me on what I'm lacking since,
     On what I felt in the times of joy and woe,
     On what I loved, on how I was forlorn
     I've yet to taste true joy, -- that is inborn;
     But you are innocent! conceived for only bliss
     Believe in it and seize each moment's portion
     Your soul was made for friendship and devotion,
     A passionate and loving kiss.
     Your soul is pure and unexposed to sadness
     Your conscience is as bright as any day
     Why then perceive the lunacy and madness
     Of the uninteresting hearsay?
     It will replace your peace with aggravation
     You'll tremble with your heart and cry in bed
     Your soul will lose its trust in agitation
     And you, perhaps... my love may grow to dread
     Who knows? perhaps forever... No, my dear
     I fear to cast the only joy away
     Don't ask for dangerous confessions here
     Today I love, I'm happy for today.
     
     ***

     I've lived to see desire vanish,
     With hope I've slowly grown to part,
     And I am left with only anguish,
     The fruit of emptiness at heart.

     Under the storms of merciless fate
     My thriving garland withered lies--
     In sadness, lonesome, I await:
     How far away is my demise?

     Thus, conquered by a tardy frost,
     Through gale's whistling and shimmer,
     Late, on a naked limb exposed
     A lonesome leaf is left to quiver...

***


     Alas! How come she's glimmering
     With temporary, charming vibe?
     It's evident that she is withering
     While youth is blossoming with life...
     Soon she will fade! Life of delight
     Not very long she has to treasure;
     And not for long will she provide
     Her happy family with pleasure.
     Her mellow wit will not abide
     To energize our conversations
     And with her soul, she won't subside
     The sufferer's lamentations.
     I hurry, still distraught in thought,
     Concealing all of my dejection,
     To catch her every cheerful word
     And to delight in her perfection.
     I watch her move, with admiration,
     Perceive each sound from her soul
     From every moment's separation
     My tender heart becomes appalled.

***


     Oh blazing Muse of pure satire!
     Come forth on my inviting call!
     I do not need the blatant lyre,
     Give me the scourge of Juvenal!
     And neither lifeless imitators
     Nor hungry, gluttonous translators,
     Nor rhymesters who don't relate,
     With epigrams shall I abate!
     Peace to the poets, poor creators,
     Peace to the journal's adulators,
     Peace to the fools who have been tamed!
     But rascals, you I'll put to shame,--
     Come forth you villains, don't resist!
     And everyone I'll punished then
     But if by chance one I shall miss,
     Please do remind me, gentlemen!
     How many faces -- shameless-pale,
     How many forehands -- dull and stale,
     From me are ready to acquire
     The timeless imprint of my lyre!
     
     Verses, composed during a night of insomnia...

     I can't sleep, the light is out;
     Chasing senseless dreams in gloom.
     Clocks at once, inside my room,
     Somewhere next to me, resound.
     Parcae's soft and mild chatter,
     Sleeping twilight's noisy flutter,
     Life's commotion -- so insane..
     Why am I to feel this pain?
     What's your meaning, boring mumble?
     Disapproving, do you grumble
     Of the day I spent in vain?
     What has made you so compelling?
     Are you calling or foretelling?
     I just want to understand,
     Thus I'm seeking your intent...
     
     Winter morning

     Cold frost and sunshine: day of wonder!
     But you, my friend, are still in slumber--
     Wake up, my beauty, time belies:
     You dormant eyes, I beg you, broaden
     Toward the northerly Aurora,
     As though a northern star arise!

     Recall last night, the snow was whirling,
     Across the sky, the haze was twirling,
     The moon, as though a pale dye,
     Emerged with yellow through faint clouds.
     And there you sat, immersed in doubts,
     And now, -- just take a look outside:

     The snow below the bluish skies,
     Like a majestic carpet lies,
     And in the light of day it shimmers.
     The woods are dusky. Through the frost
     The greenish fir-trees are exposed;
     And under ice, a river glitters.

     The room is lit with amber light.
     And bursting, popping in delight
     Hot stove still rattles in a fray.
     While it is nice to hear its clatter,
     Perhaps, we should command to saddle
     A fervent mare into the sleight?

     And sliding on the morning snow
     Dear friend, we'll let our worries go,
     And with the zealous mare we'll flee.
     We'll visit empty ranges, thence,
     The woods, which used to be so dense
     And then the shore, so dear to me.

***


     I will be silenced soon!... If on the tragic day
     The strings would answer me with pensive play;
     If only youth, would mutely grasp me first,
     They'd marvel at my love's affliction;
     If you, aroused by a mere conviction,
     In silence mumbled melancholy verse
     And loved my speaking heart in hover...
     If I am loved... allow me, my dear friend,
     New spirit to the parting lyre send --
     The sacred name of my beloved lover!...
     When with eternal sleep I will be stoned,
     Above my grave then say in inflammation:
     "He's loved by me and to me he was loaned
     In songs and love's conclusive inspiration."

***


     If by life you were deceived,
     Don't be dismal, don't be wild!
     In the day of grief, be mild
     Merry days will come, believe.

     Heart is living in tomorrow;
     Present is dejected here;
     In a moment, passes sorrow;
     That which passes will be dear.

***


     The final flowers are more dear
     Than charming maidens in the field
     And the dejected aspirations
     They reawake in us with life
     Thus sometimes separation's strife
     Is livelier than love's occasions

***


     The empty "you" for "thee"-- so mild,
     By chance, she swapped in dialogue
     And all the dreams that I've compiled
     Within my loving soul evoked.
     I stand before her very humbly,
     To look aside -- I do not dare;
     I say to her: "you" are so fair!
     And gravely think: How much I love "thee!"
     
***


     What's in my name? It's soulless,
     It shall expire, like the dismal roar
     Of waves that hit the distant shore, --
     Like nighttime noises in the forest!

     Upon the memo sheet, in grief,
     Its imprint in the stillborn gloom,
     Much like the writing on the tomb,
     In foreign language it will leave.

     What's in it? All the lost and trite
     In new and wild insurrection,
     Within your soul it won't excite
     The pure and kind recollections.

     But silently, in time of anguish
     Pronounce it softly while grieving
     Say that my memory won't vanish
     That there's a heart in which I'm living...

     
 To*** 


     Why premature exasperation
     Feed with the dismal, doomed belief,
     And thus, the certain separation
     Await alone with timid grief?
     It's not that long until dejection!
     In calmness of the barren fields,

     You will bring forth the recollection
     Of days you've lost throughout the years.
     Misfortunate! then, you'll be ready,
     With price of death to pay the debts,
     To buy a word from cherished lady, --
     The light resounding of her steps.



     A Fairytale About A Dead Princess, By: Aleksander Pushkin (1833)

     
 1
     

     The czar bid farewell to his wife,
     Packing for the road of strife,
     And czarina by the door
     Sat to wait for him alone.
     There she waits from dawn till nighttime,
     Sees the fields, and thus from sighting
     Her bright eyes are filled with blight
     From the sunrise till the night;
     Her dear friend cannot be seen!
     Only blizzards whirl and spin,
     On the fields the snow is falling,
     And the pale earth is glowing.
     Thus she sits there nine long months
     Never leaves her post, not once.
     Then from God on Christmas Eve,
     She a daughter would receive.
     Early morn, the cherished guest,
     Long awaited in unrest, --
     Finally, from lands afar
     Came back home the father-czar.
     She would gaze at him one time,
     Uttering a heavy sigh,
     All this joy she could not bare
     And she died right then and there.

     The czar for long would feel distress,
     But he is sinful like the rest,
     The dire year had passed and hence
     He had married someone else.
     His younger wife, I have to say,
     Was a czarina all the way:
     Tall and slender, pale white,
     Smart, 'most everything was right,
     Only she was proud, zealous,
     Willful, obstinate and jealous.
     As a present, to her passed
     There's a mirror that she has
     But this mirror is unique
     It has slowly learned to speak.
     Only with it would she be
     Tender, thoughtful and free
     With it, friendly she would joke
     Self-admiring, she spoke:
     "Oh my light! My mirror, say
     And don't hide the truth away:
     Am I the prettiest on earth?
     Purest, fairest, with most verve?"
     And the mirror would resound:
     "Yes you are, without a doubt,
     You're the prettiest on earth,
     Purest, fairest, with most verve."
     And czarina would then giggle
     With her shoulders she would jiggle
     With her eyes she'd wink, so happy
     That her fingers started tapping
     And she started dancing, leaping
     At the mirror always peeping.

     But the princess, -- pretty child,
     Was still blooming, all the while
     Growing, growing and she grew,
     She would slowly blossom through,
     Darkened brows and skin so tender,
     She appeared to be short-tempered.
     She had met her fiancй
     Son of king, prince Ellisay.
     Czar gave word and king was seated
     And the gift was now completed:
     Seven business trading towns
     And one hundred forty towers.

     Getting ready for the party
     Dressing up, czarina darling,
     By her mirror comes to sit
     And begins to question it:
     "Am I the prettiest on earth?
     Purest, fairest, with most verve?"
     How does mirror then resound?
     "You are pretty, there's no doubt,
     But the princess, on this earth
     Is the purest with most verve"
     Scared czarina jumped away,
     Raised her hand up in a fray
     Hit the mirror best she could
     Stomping fiercely with her foot.
     "O, you lying piece of glass!
     O, how dare you curse me thus?
     She will never match my grace
     I will put her in her place!
     How she grew before my sight!
     It is known why she's so white;
     Pregnant mother while mourning
     Sat the snowy fields observing.
     Mirror, tell me: how can she
     Be more beautiful than me?
     Now confess that I'm more pretty:
     In the boundaries of our city,
     No one's prettier than I
     Is it so?" The glass replied:
     "But the princess' still more charming
     Still more beautiful, more darling."
     Nothing left to do. And she,
     Overfilled with jealousy,
     Threw the glass under the bench
     Called her maid, an older wretch,
     And czarina, now irate
     Told her older chambermaid,
     "Take the princess to the forest
     Tie her up and leave her soulless
     Leave her there under the pine
     So the wolves may come to dine!"

     A raging dame who can persuade?
     It's useless. Thus the chambermaid
     Took the princess to the woods
     Deep and with so many loops
     That the princess guessed the purpose,
     And became afraid and nervous,
     And implored half-shocked, half-stunned:
     "Tell me, what is it I've done?
     I beseech you, spare me, friend,
     Do not leave me here to stand,
     I'll repay you then for all!"
     And the maid, who in her soul,
     Liked the princess, did not fled
     Let her go and simply said:
     "God be with you." And alone,
     She would slowly travel home.
     There, czarina was all ready:
     "Where's the dear and charming lady?
     --"In the woods, alone she stands"
     She replied, "tied are her legs
     I have lashed her as I clutched her
     If by chance a beast shall catch her,
     Not for long will she sustain
     She will die with much less pain."

     And the rumors were disclosed
     Daughter of the czar is lost!
     And the czar now grieves away.
     Future husband, Ellisay,
     Prayed to God for all the best,
     And now sets out on a quest
     For her rescue. He is ready
     To bring back his cherished lady.

     While young princess all alone,
     Wandered in the woods till dawn,
     Rambled, rambled all around
     And a wooden tower found.
     Towards her, a dog ran up,
     Barked with playfulness and stopped.
     To the door she'd slowly start--
     All was quiet in the yard.
     And the dog she'd dearly pet,
     Then, the princess walked ahead
     By the door, she came to stop
     In her hand she held the knob
     Heavy door was opened wide
     And the princess went inside
     In the chamber, all around
     Benches stood with carpets covered,
     And a table made of wood,
     And a tile stove there stood,
     And the princess now could tell:
     Here, good people had to dwell;
     She will not regret here stopping!
     All the while, no one's coming.
     For the owners she would gaze
     Then she cleaned the dirty place
     Lit a candle for the Lord,
     Lit the fire in the stove,
     On the planking, she would climb,
     And there, peacefully reclined.

     Lunchtime hour was now close
     Footsteps in the yard arose
     Seven stalwarts entered then
     Seven strong and handsome men.
     Eldest uttered: "What a dream!
     All is beautiful and clean.
     Someone cleaned inside our home
     And awaited us alone.
     Who are you? Just let us see,
     And a friend to us you'll be.
     If you are an elder man
     You shall be our uncle then.
     If you are a youthful male
     As a brother you'll be hailed.
     If you're just an elder lady
     Be our mother, we are ready,
     If you are a pretty dame
     Then our sister you'll become."

     And the frightened princess would
     Come out forth with a salute.
     Bowing gracefully in meekness,
     She then asked them for forgiveness,
     For she entered uninvited
     Seeking rest since she was tired.
     And they instantly affirmed,
     That they all accepted her.
     In the corner, she was seated,
     With a pie was nicely greeted,
     A full glass for her to drink,
     On a tray to her they'd bring.
     But the fresh and hearty wine
     With a smile she'd decline.
     And a little of the pie
     Just to sample she would try,
     Then, the languor to relieve
     She was kindly granted leave.
     And to rest her, they had led
     Wearied princess to the bed
     And allowed her to repose
     And in slumber she would doze.

     Day by day is flashing by
     And the princess by-and-by
     In the woods, now lives content
     With the seven stalwart men.
     And a little before dawning
     Brothers are together going
     To just wander and relax,
     On the hunt for wild ducks,
     To please the tired arm, with force,
     To throw the robber off the horse,
     Or to cut off the heavy head
     The evil Tatar to behead
     From the forest, to deface
     The circassian feeble race.
     As a housekeeper, she
     Inside alone all day would be,
     Cooking, cleaning 'round the den
     Never contradicting them
     And they're never disagreeing
     Thus the days are quickly fleeing.
